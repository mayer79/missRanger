## Re-Re-Resubmission

Note from incoming pre-checks:

* checking LazyData ... NOTE

However, they all seem to be related to a smallish dataset. I have replaced it with a larger dataset and hope the problems will vanish.

## Resubmission:

Fixing a failing unit test on Solaris which needs to be fixed according to Brian's e-mail below:
